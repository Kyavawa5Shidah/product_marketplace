i was able to implement the frontend and backend
I used vscode tool, backend used django and frontend used react(next.js) and all are in the same folder
i assumed the cilent of the app is the first super user then he or she can create any other users when logged in but when creating the user they provide the desirable passwords that means no super user can decide or the system cannot auto generate the passwords
i tried to auto gnertae passwords for the users created but i was limited since i have gmail.
